						<h3>Event Summary</h3>
						<p>The first ToryTechs Hackathon held on the 15th/16th of February 2020 at the London College of
							Political Technologists addressed one theme: How can we improve MP offices? The 25
							participants at the event worked collaboratively to address challenges related to this
							theme. The event was planned, hosted, and funded by Joseph Reeve and Waverley Coquet, the
							founders of ToryTechs, with a goal to create a community of conservative-friendly
							technologists, designers, politicians & activists who want to British politics through tech
							and collaboration. Supported by Edward Saperia, the Founder and Dean of the London College of Political
							Technologists, ToryTechs has been able to make their mark on the map with this event.
						</p>
						<h3>Why ToryTechs?</h3>
						<p>We started ToryTechs because <b>we believe that democracy works better when everyone has good
								tools.</b> Some groups, such as Campaign Lab and the Lib Dems Software Group, have
							created similar communities to tackle the challenges we are currently facing as a democracy.
							However, there was a general feeling that conservatives were not welcome in these spaces.
							From this sentiment, ToryTechs was born as we recognise that conservative thinkers,
							creators, and technologists have a lot to offer in terms of innovative solutions, know-how,
							and general technological prowess. It is our goal to create a community of conservative
							practitioners who will build and maintain tools to help democracy.
						</p>
						<h3>Why Run a Hackathon?</h3>
						<p><i>Hackathons are weekend events for technologists, designers, and domain experts to come
								together and solve problems in an intensive and collaborative way. If you are unfamiliar
								with this type of event, you can read more about them here:
								https://hackathon.guide/.</i>
						</p>
						<p>Hackathons are an intense and fun event format for finding innovative solutions as they bring
							together people with different backgrounds, areas of expertise, and abilities. They can be
							great for building a community around a specific problem, such as inefficiencies in
							government. Typically, the projects that come out of hackathons are MVPs and therefore not
							very practical - they are more about showing an approach to solving a problem rather than
							solving problems themselves. This being said, we were amazed at the immediate applicability
							of the projects that came out of the first ToryTechs Hackathon.
						</p>
						<p>The usefulness of projects made at the event, the interest on social media, and the
							collaborative nature of the people who attended the event have convinced us that there is an
							appetite in the tech community for more events like this. As such, ToryTechs Hackathon #1
							will be the first of many ToryTech events. We are excited to see how this community will
							evolve and the type of projects we can kickstart at upcoming events.
						</p>
						<h3>Response to the Event</h3>
						<p>The creation of ToryTechs caused a buzz in the local community and attracted a fair amount of
							attention. The event was attended by people from many walks of life, and across the
							political spectrum. Many people persevered in spite of travel delays and
							uncharacteristically bad weather as a result of Storm Dennis. There was a great deal of
							engagement from attendees, and from those that were interested in the event that couldn’t
							make it. The ToryTechs <a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/HLnoXpNgndgGFenHtIw4dT"
								class="link" target="_blank">WhatsApp group</a> was lively and will continue to be used
							by the
							community. The ToryTechs Twitter account also had a good amount of engagement throughout the
							course of the event. It is our hope that our continued effort in this space will be of use
							to those working in government and this show of support was encouraging.
						</p>
						<h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
						<p>We are planning to run monthly Hack Nights (with dinner provided) at <a
								href="https://www.nwspk.com/" target="_blank" class=link>The London College of
								Political Technologists</a> in Shoreditch. These events will be a space for the
							community to
							meet regularly, maintain existing projects, develop new tools, and support each other.
						</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Open, democracy focused community events (national and local)</li>
								<li>Tory-specific, campaigning tool focused events</li>
								<li>Training events for Tory campaigners or those in office who would like to improve
									their technical capabilities</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<h3>Future Partnerships</h3>
						<p>Like most things, going-it-alone is unlikely to render the best results and we are interested
							in finding ways to work with other groups to achieve maximum impact.
						</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>MP Offices (to find more ways technology can help them be more effective)</li>
								<li>Our Labour counterpart, CampaignLab</li>
								<li>Local associations (for training)</li>
								<li>Government & Party</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<h3>Projects</h3>
						<p>There were a high number of useful and well thought out projects created at the event. We
							were impressed at the teams’ abilities to come up with user-friendly solutions that were
							highly applicable to the challenges that were presented.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<h3>First Prize - aMPlify</h3>
								<p>aMPlify is a non-partisan documentation project that is all about helping MPs and
									their staff find resources that make them more effective. This will be an ongoing
									project supported by ToryTechs.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Second Prize - Parliament Calendar Subscription</h3>
								<p>Parliament Calendar Subscription is a tool for automatically adding the agenda from
									calendar.parliament.uk to an MPs Outlook calendar. Up to this point, the process of
									updating calendars has been done manually by MP staff.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Third Prize - Question Deadline Calendar Subscription</h3>
								<p>This tool extracts question deadlines from <a
										href="https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-table-office/OralQuestionsRota.pdf"
										target="_blank" class=link>OralQuestionsRota.pdf</a>
									(published by Parliament) and adds reminders to MP calendars. We hope this will help
									reduce manual
									work MP staff have to do, and will ensure MPs always get the chance to ask important
									questions of their peers.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Honorary Mentions</h3>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<h3>Leaftrax</h3>
									<p>LeafTrax was an experimental project that could be used in leafleting. It
										provides a way to link location and address to online survey responses. With
										the right data privacy considerations and a user dashboard, this project has
										the potential to become an essential tool in the belt of campaigners not
										just in the UK, but worldwide.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>MPFree</h3>
									<p>MPfree is an excellent idea that, with more development, could help
										constituents contact the right people faster, and reduce incoming MP office
										casework that should be going to councils or government departments. It’s a
										form that can be embedded in MP websites that directs, sorts, and tags
										messages in a similar way to https://www.writetothem.com/
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Permit API</h3>
									<p>Permit API is an ongoing project that provides a standardised interface to
										access permits given by local and national government (e.g. Planning
										Applications, Environmental Damage Permits, etc.).</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<h3>Closing</h3>
						<p>We are truly grateful for the outpouring of support from the community to help us make this
							event a reality. This hackathon was the first of many events that ToryTechs has planned and
							we would like to welcome you all to attend our next event, a Hack Night (with dinner) hosted
							by <a href="https://www.nwspk.com/" target="_blank" class=link>The London College of
								Political Technologists</a> where we will continue to build the
							community and encourage existing community members to maintain tools that were built at the
							hackathon.
						</p>
						<p>ToryTechs is looking forward to participating in an ongoing conversation about the importance
							of technology and democracy. We are happy that so many people have seen value in our work
							and our collaborative approach to problem solving - we hope to continue to be a positive
							force in the political-tech community.
						</p>
						<p>We want to give a big thanks to everyone who understood our vision of openness and
							transparency for the event.
